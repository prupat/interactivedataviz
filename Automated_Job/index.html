  <h4>Project Overview</h4>
  <p>In response to the rising concerns surrounding the impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence on employment, this capstone project, titled "Assessing Job Vulnerability and Employment Growth in the Era of Large Language Models," aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis, particularly focusing on white-collar occupations. The rapid evolution of technology, coupled with the potential for automation, necessitates an in-depth exploration of job vulnerability to empower affected workers and inform key stakeholders.</p>
